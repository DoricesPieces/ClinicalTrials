    "**More information is needed to determine a correlation bewteen alternative therapies clinical trials and the most common natural causes of death in the United States.  Obesity was the highest condition researched in the alternative therapies sample set.  Obesity considered a factor in the onset of multiple health issues, so we cannot say they obesity and alternative therapys study with it are not a result of a common cause of deaths like heart disease.  Cancer alternative therapy clinical trial were the second most researched, and cancer is the second leading cause of death.  Perhaps the data set was too small to determine a correlation or alternative therapy research is not a result of a national need.**"
